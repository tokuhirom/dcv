# dcv - Docker Container Viewer

DCV is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) tool for monitoring Docker containers and Docker Compose applications.

## Features

- View all Docker containers (both standalone and Docker Compose managed)
- List and manage Docker images
- List and manage Docker networks
- List and manage Docker volumes with size information
- Browse files inside containers
- Execute shell commands in containers
- Inspect container configuration
- List and manage Docker Compose containers
- Switch between multiple Docker Compose projects
- Real-time container log streaming (shows last 1000 lines, then follows new logs)
- Manage containers inside Docker-in-Docker (dind) containers
- Vim-style key bindings and command-line interface
- Help view accessible with `?` key
- Quit confirmation dialog for safer exits
- Display executed commands for debugging

## Views

For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts and commands, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md).

### Docker Container List View

Displays `docker ps` results in a table format. Shows all Docker containers, not limited to Docker Compose.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#docker-container-list).

### Docker Compose Process List View

Displays `docker compose ps` results in a table format.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#docker-compose-process-list).

### Log View

Displays container logs. Initially shows the last 1000 lines, then streams new logs in real-time.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#log-view).

### Docker-in-Docker Process List View

Shows containers running inside a dind container.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#docker-in-docker).

### Image List View

Displays Docker images with repository, tag, ID, creation time, and size information.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#image-list).

### Network List View

Displays Docker networks with ID, name, driver, scope, and container count.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#network-list).

### Volume List View

Displays Docker volumes with name, driver, scope, size, creation time, and reference count.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#volume-list).

### File Browser View

Browse the filesystem inside a container. Navigate directories and view file contents.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#file-browser).

### File Content View

View the contents of a file from within a container.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#file-content).

### Inspect View

Displays the full Docker inspect output for containers, images, or networks in JSON format with syntax highlighting.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#inspect-view).

### Top View

Shows process information (docker compose top) for the selected container.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#top-view).

### Stats View

Shows container resource usage statistics including CPU, memory, network I/O, and block I/O.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#stats-view).

### Compose Project List View

Shows all Docker Compose projects on the system.

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#project-list).

### Help View

Shows all available keyboard shortcuts and their corresponding commands for the current view.

The help view displays three columns:
- **Key**: The keyboard shortcut (e.g., 'j' or 'down')
- **Command**: The vim-style command that can be used in command mode (e.g., ':down')
- **Description**: What the action does

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#help-view).

### Command Mode

Vim-style command line interface for executing commands.

**Built-in commands:**
- `:q` or `:quit`: Quit the application (with confirmation)
- `:q!` or `:quit!`: Force quit without confirmation
- `:h` or `:help`: Show help view
- `:help commands`: List all available commands in current view

All key handler functions can be called as commands. For a complete list of available commands in each view, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#command-mode) or use `:help commands` in command mode.

## Usage

### Options

```bash
dcv [-debug <logfile>]
```

- `-debug <logfile>`: Enable debug logging to a file

### Examples

```bash
# Start dcv with the default initial view (docker containers)
dcv

# Start dcv with debug logging
dcv -debug dcv.log

# Configure initial view via config file (see Configuration section)
# To start with Docker Compose view: set initial_view = "compose" in config
# To start with project list: set initial_view = "projects" in config
```

## Configuration

DCV supports configuration through a TOML file located at:
- `~/.config/dcv/config.toml` - User config directory

### Configuration Options

```toml
[general]
# Initial view to show on startup
# Valid values: "docker", "compose", "projects"
# Default: "docker"
initial_view = "docker"
```

### Example Configuration

```bash
# Create config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/dcv

# Create config file
cat > ~/.config/dcv/config.toml << EOF
[general]
initial_view = "compose"
EOF
```

## Installation

### Using go install

```bash
go install github.com/tokuhirom/dcv@latest
```

### Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokuhirom/dcv.git
cd dcv
go build -o dcv
./dcv
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.23 or later (for building from source)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Terminal with TUI support

## Implementation Details

- Language: Go
- TUI Framework: [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- Styling: [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)
- Testing: testify

### Architecture

- Uses Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern
- Async log streaming
- Shows executed commands on error for easier debugging
- Comprehensive unit tests

## Command Execution View

Shows real-time output when executing Docker commands (start, stop, restart, kill, rm, docker compose up/down).

For keyboard shortcuts, see [docs/keymap.md](docs/keymap.md#command-execution).

## Debugging Features

- Commands are displayed when executing operations
- Real-time streaming output for all Docker operations
- Error messages with exit codes
- Color-coded status indicators (success/failure)

## Development

### Setting up development environment

```bash
# Install all development dependencies including lefthook
make dev-deps
```

This will install:
- golangci-lint for linting
- goimports for code formatting
- lefthook for git hooks

### Git Hooks (Lefthook)

This project uses [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) to ensure code quality:

- **Pre-commit**: Automatically formats Go code and runs quick tests
- **Pre-push**: Runs full linting and test suite

To manually run hooks:
```bash
lefthook run pre-commit
lefthook run pre-push
```

### Running tests

```bash
make test
```

### Building

```bash
make all
```

### Formatting code

```bash
make fmt
```
